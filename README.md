# Frontend-2 & Week-1 - Project
This project demonstrates basic JavaScript array operations on a list of employees.  
It uses array methods like **map**, **forEach**, **push**, **filter**, and **concat** to perform tasks such as:

- Logging all developers
- Adding a new employee
- Removing admins
- Concatenating with another array of employees

The output of each operation is displayed in the browser console.
